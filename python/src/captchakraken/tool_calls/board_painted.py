"""Has the widget painted its puzzle yet, or are we photographing the rebuild hole?

Measured on gt4.geetest.com's slide demo (2026-09-12): 6 of 52 requests carried a board with under 5% ink and
every one came back dead centre. The settle gate cannot catch it because a blank panel is perfectly still.
Structure is measured, not ink, because geetest_v4_svg is line art on white. A caller must treat False as
"wait a moment longer", never "give up": a gate that can refuse to ever take a picture is worse than the blank one.
