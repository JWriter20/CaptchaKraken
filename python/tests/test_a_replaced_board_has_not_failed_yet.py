# A replaced board has failed nothing yet, so it gets no second look.
#
# The second look buys a recording for a board that failed a round as a still. "One film, one board" gave every
# board its own look by resetting `_animated_probe_done` in `_fresh_board()`, but the solve loop armed the probe
# at every loop head from attempt 2 — a stand-in for "the last round failed" that only holds while the SAME
# board is up. On a vendor that deals a new board after every answer, that filmed every still board after the
# solve's first miss. Measured in Tier 3 on a five-board fixture that re-deals after every answer, the way
# hCaptcha does: seven second looks, 28.8s of recording in a 48.3s session, against the client's own 45s
# budget. The same client without the per-board reset ran it in 41.8s; JS, which arms only on evidence, in 35s.
