# ONE FILM, ONE BOARD, at the point the board actually changes.
#
# The film accumulates across rounds so each ask sees more of the board, and a recorded answer may be reused
# once — the widget refuses it, the no-progress fence spots the repeat, and the next round re-asks. That reuse
# was never bounded to the board it was cut from, so when the vendor dealt a DIFFERENT puzzle the plan
# survived it and the next animated round replayed the old board's coordinates onto the new one.
#
# Measured live on 2026-09-16 (Abyss, hCaptcha, attempt 17 of the diagnosis run): a keyframe answer cut from
# round 3's board — [[0.809, 0.088, 0.833, 0.112]], the top-right of the banner, where hCaptcha paints the
# REFERENCE PHOTO — was replayed in round 5 against a board two deals later, logged as "reusing the recorded
# answer — same board, same screens". Nothing checked that claim. Six rounds produced no real attempt.
#
# `_fresh_board()` is the seam the verdict loop calls the moment a next round has painted, and it is where the
# film has to end: `_stop_animated_film` already documents that a gone board's film can never describe the
# next one. These pin that it is actually called from there.
