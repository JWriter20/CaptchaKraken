# A round is decided from the board it can see.
#
# Two questions open every round, and both are answered from the widget as it stands at that instant:
# WHICH EXPERT answers it, read out of the DOM as "is there a text box in here", and WHETHER THE BOARD
# CYCLES, read off its motion. A widget that has not drawn yet answers both wrongly in the same way —
# it holds no text box to find, and the only motion it has is its own arrival.
#
# Measured on 2026-09-17: a resolved vendor frame holding zero elements sent a distorted-text board to
# the still expert, and a classifier that started before the board painted spent its window on a blank
# widget and called a board that cycles a still — which is then answered from one screen, clicked, and
# refused. Both are the same mistake, so both are fixed by asking after the paint rather than before.
