# A continuous animation never shows a screen twice and never holds one, so a burst that only knew "a screen came
# back" or "nothing new for a floor window" filmed it to the ceiling and called it a still. The JS port already
# treats many screens still arriving as animated; this pins the Python port to the same verdict.
