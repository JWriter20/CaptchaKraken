# A request in flight cannot be cancelled, so the timeout it was SENT with is the only thing bounding it.
#
# `_check_deadline` is read between steps. A single ask that hangs is therefore unbounded by anything the
# solve loop does, and the planner used to send every one of them with a hardcoded 120s — 2.7x the whole
# 45s solve budget. Measured against the hosted endpoint on 2026-09-17: one ask hung, gave up after ~124s
# with "the write operation timed out", and the attempt ran 143.3s of which 123.9s was that single call.
#
# The caller owns the number now: whatever is left of the solve, floored so a nearly-spent budget still
# buys a real attempt rather than a certain timeout.
