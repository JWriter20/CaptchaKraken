# One burst can only show the model the screens that fell inside its window — measured, a 4s burst against a 5.3s cycle showed
# two screens of three — and the answer it produces is identical next round by construction, because sampling is greedy over the
# same frames. So a refused animated answer was re-pressed until the no-progress fence tripped, three rounds in, with half the
# solve budget unspent. Measured live 2026-09-15: hCaptcha's animated board read 2/15 and 6/12 on the two served models.
#
# The film now accumulates for the whole solve, so every round asks against strictly more of the board than the last ask saw.
# The JS port films CONTINUOUSLY, through inference and the verdict wait; sync Playwright is thread-affine, so this port films
# another chunk per round instead. Different density, same contract — which is what these pin.
