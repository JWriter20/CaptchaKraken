/**
 * The watcher's contract, driven against a fake solver.

 * A fake rather than a browser on purpose: every behaviour worth pinning here

 * throwing callback kill the loop — is about the LOOP, and a real page would
 * make each of them slow and flaky without testing anything extra. The
 * puppeteer/playwright surface is covered separately in
