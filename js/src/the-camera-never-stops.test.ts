// no-progress fence tripped, three rounds in, with half the solve budget unspent. Measured live on
// 2026-09-15, hCaptcha's animated board read 2/15 and 6/12 on the two served models that way, against 36/36
// on the driver that still re-filmed every round.
//
// The camera now runs for the whole solve and every round slices a STRICTLY LONGER film. These tests drive
// the real recorder — a fake `shot` is the only stub in the filming path — because the bug was in when the
// recording stopped, and a fake recorder cannot be wrong about that.
