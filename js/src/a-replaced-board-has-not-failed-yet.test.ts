// A replaced board has failed nothing yet, so it gets no second look.
//
// The second look buys a recording for a board that did not solve as a still, and `repeatedAnswerSeen` is
// what arms it. "One film, one board" gave every board its own look by resetting `animatedProbeDone` when the
// vendor deals a new one — but left the arm standing, so evidence found on ONE board (a repeat, the widget
// moving mid-inference) filmed every still board dealt after it. Python had the same shape and ran a Tier 3
// fixture that re-deals after every answer in 48.3s against the client's own 45s budget, 28.8s of it recording
// boards that had never failed.
