// ONE FILM, ONE BOARD, at the point the board actually changes.
//
// The whole-solve camera keeps filming across rounds so each ask sees a longer film, and a recorded answer
// may be reused once — the widget refuses it, `noteAnswer` spots the repeat, and the next round re-asks. That
// reuse was never bounded to the board it was cut from. When the vendor deals a DIFFERENT puzzle, the plan
// survived it, and the next animated round replayed the old board's coordinates onto the new one.
//
// Measured live on 2026-09-16 (Abyss, hCaptcha, attempt 17 of the diagnosis run): a keyframe answer cut from
// round 3's board — `[[0.809, 0.088, 0.833, 0.112]]`, the top-right of the banner, which is where hCaptcha
// paints the REFERENCE PHOTO — was replayed in round 5 against a board two deals later, logged as "reusing
// the recorded answer — same board, same screens". Nothing had checked that claim. Six rounds produced no
// real attempt and the run ended "still detected after 6 solve loops".
